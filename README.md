Representation Dashboard – Team Implementation Plan
Our team will build a lightweight but extendable proof-of-concept dashboard that visualizes 1) gender representation and 2) lived experiences across Montréal entrepreneurship hubs. The work blends outreach, data science, marketing, and product design, and will therefore need expertise in each of those areas. 
TEAM Roles
These can be pretty fluid, but it’s useful to have some ideas of what we’ll want
Data/Technical
Finalize metric dictionary
Build data templates
Set up GitHub repos and prototype dashboard
Run EDA and simple NLP
Outreach & Partnerships
Build and maintain relationships with hubs
Schedule meetings
Manage data-sharing processes
Follow up with hub administrators
Marketing & Narrative
Develop founder recruitment messaging
Design questionnaire and distribution plan
Coordinate anonymous narrative collection
Assist with qualitative coding
Product & Integration
Oversee dashboard structure
Integrate visuals + qualitative insights
Maintain consistency across deliverables
Prepare pitch materials for testing


1. Upcoming Timeline 
FIRST ACTIONS
Finalize metrics
Finalize data template
Set up GitHub (readme only)
Draft outreach materials
Next Steps
Begin contacting hubs
Finalize questionnaire
Build basic dashboard skeleton (VERY MUCH A DRAFT as it will depend on data availability)
Create marketing materials for founders
Versions for different channels
Put an easy website together to host questionnaire and background info
Data Collection and Draft Presentation
Collect early qualitative responses
Begin visual prototyping
Meet with at least one hub to validate data schema


Presentation Refinement
Start assembling quantitative + qualitative insights
Refine dashboard visuals
Prepare for first pilot test 
2. Core Metrics to Define ASAP (ALL)
GOAL: define metrics to be gathered from hubs and questionnaire. 
These are the minimum viable variables needed to surface the key representation gaps identified in the problem report. They should be small in number, easy for hubs to provide, and directly tied to the pipeline stages.
A. Team-Level Metrics
Team gender composition (women-led / mixed-gender / men-led)
Team size
Sector (tech, retail, healthcare, social enterprise, etc.)
ACTION (ALL): draft list to share


B. Pipeline Progression Metrics
For each participating team in a program, capture the stage they reached:
Applied
Accepted into initial program (e.g., Lean Startup)
Participated in mentorship
Advanced to accelerator
Received non-equity funding from program
Received external funding (optional, only if hubs track this)
Action (ALL): Draft list to share


C. Outcome + Experience Metrics
Completion status (finished, dropped, withdrew)
Founders’ self-reported needs (from qualitative instrument)
Other Metrics TBD?
ACTION (ALL): Draft list to share


D. Qualitative Coding Framework (for later NLP)
These themes are pre-identified from our research; they can help structure the qualitative pipeline:
“Closed networks / access barriers”


“Bias or gendered questioning in evaluation”


“Mentorship gaps”


“Credibility or legitimacy challenges”


“Childcare / time constraints”


“Confidence / self-advocacy factors”


“Positive experiences”
ACTION (ALL): Draft list to share


Defining these early allows us to bake them into our questionnaire.
ACTION: Deliverable by [DATE]: a draft one-page dictionary of the metrics above that all team members can reference. This is the DATA TEMPLATE to be shared with hubs

3. Initial Outreach Plan (Led by Outreach/Partnerships Team)
Goal: secure at least two pilot hubs willing to share any data and circulate the qualitative questionnaire.
A. Target Hubs
ACTION: Prioritize the below:
McGill Dobson Centre
UQAM ESG Entrepreneurship Centre
Concordia (Lorenzetti Centre)
HEC Parcours Femmes en Affaires


B. Outreach Message Framework (short)
This is a student-led proof of concept, not a performance evaluation.
The dashboard helps hubs demonstrate leadership in EDI transparency.
Any level of data is acceptable—even disaggregated counts.
They retain control over what is shared publicly.
Draft: 
Subject: Invitation to Partner: Representation Dashboard for Women Entrepreneurs (IMSF Project)
Hi [Name],
I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing as part of a four-person student team in McGill’s Integrated Management Student Fellowship (IMSF). We’re developing a small proof-of-concept Representation Dashboard in order to visualize gender participation and experiences within Montréal entrepreneurship programs.
One of the challenges we’ve uncovered is the lack of consistent gender-disaggregated data across the pipeline (applications, mentorship, accelerator stages, etc.). Our dashboard aims to address this by creating a simple, standardized structure that programs can use to track and communicate their commitment to equity and inclusion.
What we’re asking for is intentionally very low-lift:
small, anonymized counts (e.g., # women-led teams admitted, # progressing to next stages),


and/or a conversation about what data is feasible to share.


We are not evaluating program performance. Our goal is to help surface representation patterns that are currently invisible and build a tool that future cohorts can expand.
If you're open to chatting, we’d love to schedule a brief 20–30 minute meeting. We can share our one-page overview and the minimal data template.
Thank you for considering this, and we’d be excited to collaborate with you.
Best regards,
 [Your Name]
